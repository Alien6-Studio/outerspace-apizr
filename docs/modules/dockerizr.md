## Introduction

The Dockerizr module is a dedicated sub-component of OuterSpace Apizr. Crafted in Python, its main objective is to simplify and expedite the dockerization process for Python-based projects. The module has undergone rigorous testing and is compatible with Python 3.8 and subsequent versions.

---

## Features

### Automated Dockerfile Generation

Dockerizr automatically crafts a Dockerfile tailored to the specific needs of your Python project.

### Custom Entrypoint Support

Allows users to specify custom startup scripts or commands that will be executed prior to the main application's launch.

### Dependency Analysis

Identifies and generates a requirements.txt file by analyzing imports from the project's source code.

### Gunicorn Configuration

Generates an optimal configuration for Gunicorn, enabling your FastAPI application to run efficiently in production environments.

## Usage

### Python Script

To leverage Dockerizr, ensure you have Python 3.8 or a later version installed. Upon verification, you can incorporate the Dockerizr module into your Python script or notebook as illustrated:

```python
from dockerizr.generator.dockerfileGenerator import DockerGenerator
from dockerizr.configuration import DockerizrConfiguration

# Define the necessary configuration parameters
config = DockerizrConfiguration(
    project_path="path_to_your_project",
    docker_image="desired_docker_image_name",
    python_version=(3, 8),  # example Python version
    # ... any other necessary configurations ...
)

# Initialize the DockerGenerator with the configuration
generator = DockerGenerator(config)

# Generate the Dockerfile content
dockerfile_content = generator.dockerfile_generator()

```

This will yield the Dockerfile content for the provided project path.

### Usecase

#### Introduction to Usecase

Dockerizr streamlines the creation of a containerized setup for Python applications. Given an API file produced by FastApizr, Dockerizr generates:

- A `Dockerfile` that defines how the application should be containerized.
- A `requirements.txt` that lists all the necessary Python packages.
- A `wsgi.py` that serves as an entry point for the Gunicorn server.
- A `gunicorn.conf.py` that configures the Gunicorn server for optimal performance.

With these files in place, your Python application is primed for containerization and deployment using Docker.

### Module Structure and Usage

```code
Dockerizr
│
├── main.py - Entry point to interact with Dockerizr functionalities.
│
└── generator
    ├── dockerfileGenerator.py - Handles Dockerfile generation.
    │   ├── generate_dockerfile() - Writes the Dockerfile content to the project's main folder.
    │   ├── dockerfile_generator() - Crafts Dockerfile content using a Jinja2 template.
    |
    ├── requirementsAnalyzr.py - Manages the generation of the `requirements.txt` file.
    │   ├── generate_requirements() - Produces `requirements.txt` based on project imports.

    │   ├── gunicorn_conf_generator() - Crafts Gunicorn configuration content using a Jinja2
    |
    ├── errorLogger.py - A decorator to log exceptions raised by decorated functions.

        ├── wsgi-conf.jinja - Jinja2 template for Gunicorn configuration file generation
        └── start.sh - Script to run the application
```

### Docker

For Docker-based utilization of the Dockerizr module, ensure Docker is set up on your system. Once validated, the Dockerizr image can be fetched from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull outerspace.alien6.com/dockerizr
```

The Dockerizr container can then be initiated as:

```bash
docker run -it --rm outerspace.alien6.com/dockerizr
```

### Dockerfile Explanation

The Dockerfile is an essential component in dockerizing applications. Here's a breakdown of the configurations and their purposes:

1. **Base Image**: The `python:3.11-alpine3.18` image is utilized due to its lightweight nature, ensuring reduced image sizes and faster deployment.
2. **Dependencies**: Packages are updated and essential dependencies like gcc and musl-dev are installed. These are crucial for the compilation of certain Python libraries.
3. **Non-privileged User**: A non-privileged user is created to run the application. This is a security measure to prevent the application from making unintended system-level changes inside the container.
4. **Environment Variables**: The `PYTHONPATH` is set to ensure the source code is correctly detected by Python.
5. **Dependencies Installation**: Dependencies are fetched from the `requirements.txt` to ensure all necessary packages for the application's operation are present.
6. **Port Exposure**: Port 5001 is exposed, making the application accessible.
7. **Health Check**: A health check ensures the application's continuous operation.
8. **Execution Command**: Gunicorn serves the application, ensuring enhanced performance and effective request handling.

### Gunicorn Configuration Explanation

Gunicorn is a Python WSGI HTTP server that's employed for serving Python applications in production environments. Here's an understanding of the configuration:

1. **Bind**: The application is bound to `0.0.0.0:5001`, making it accessible from any IP address.
2. **Workers**: Setting workers to 2 allows for request processing parallelism, improving performance for concurrent applications.
3. **Worker Class**: Specifying the `uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker` class enables Gunicorn to serve ASGI applications like FastAPI.
4. **Timeout**: This ensures that overly time-consuming requests are terminated, preventing server overloads.
5. **Logging**: Logging levels and formats are defined to effectively monitor the application's operations.
